I work on the analysis of (mainly nonlinear hyperbolic) partial differential equations (PDEs) and associated control and optimization problems. 


Broadly speaking, my current research is focused in PDEs modeling 

- gas dynamics (compressible Euler equations)
- Nonlinear acoustics and ultrasound waves

and specific related problems include 
- Wellposedness and regularity theory for initial-boundary value problems
- Boundary controllability and stabilization/stabilizability
- Singular perturbation problems
- PDE constrained optimal boundary control problems with control/state constraints
- Energy Markets and related generalized Nash equilibrium problems
- Model predictive control
